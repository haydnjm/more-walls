          It&apos;s a great time to be a climber in Amsterdam. We have an
          amazing selection of cool gyms all over the city where you can have a
          climb, meet awesome people and grab a beer üçª

          While we&apos;re super lucky to have access to all of this great
          climbing and bouldering, I keep getting the feeling that we&apos;re
          not getting the most out of what Amsterdam&apos;s bouldering and
          climbing scene has to offer:

            Like skiing, mountain biking, or hiking a big part of the fun of
            climbing is attempting new routes that you&apos;ve never tried
            before. While the gyms do a great job resetting routes quite
            regularly, if you are going to the same gym 3 times per week
            it&apos;s likely you&apos;ll finish all the routes at your level
            before it&apos;s resetting time.

            It&apos;s nice to go with climbing with friends - but if one friend
            has a subscription to one gym and another to different gym it can be
            tough to climb all together. At least one person is paying for a
            membership and then they need to pay full price for a single entry
            to a different gym so that they can climb with everyone else.

            It&apos;s always possible to just keep buying single entries or
            stripcards so that you can stay flexible, but this can get pretty
            expensive if you are climbing regularly! If you&apos;re climbing 2-3
            times per week it can easily add up to more than ‚Ç¨100 per month,
            which sucks considering that a monthly subscription fee to a gym is
            around ‚Ç¨50.
