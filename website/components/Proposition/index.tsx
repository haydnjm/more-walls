        More Walls is a service that encourages climbers to climb. By{" "}

        climbers can get entry at discounted prices.

        By getting more people into the gym, nore frequently, we can lower the
        entry costs (and have lots more fun climbing üòâ). Climbers get to climb
        for cheaper and gyms keep their walls full - so everybody wins!
